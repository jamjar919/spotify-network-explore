# Spotify Network Explorer
Explore your Spotify playlists with a network view of your playlists over time.

## How do I get it running?
Quickstart:
 - `git clone https://github.com/jamjar919/spotify-network-explore.git`
 - `cd spotify-network-explore`
 - `yarn install`
 - `yarn run build`

By default this runs the server at [http://localhost.com:80](http://localhost.com:80), which you can then open in your browser.
